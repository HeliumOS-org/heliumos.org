            "content": "### A different approach\r\n\r\nThis alpha release of HeliumOS is different from the first alpha. KDE Plasma is replaced by GNOME and a Debian base by CentOS Stream. Most importantly, HeliumOS is a proper \"immutable\" distro. HeliumOS now uses bootc to manage updates to the base system delivered using OCI images.\r\n\r\n### Why HeliumOS?\r\n\r\nThose wanting a leading-edge immutable Linux distribution may be better served by the Fedora Atomic Desktops. However each Fedora release has a lifecycle of only 13 months. HeliumOS intends to provide a more stable platform, one measured in years rather than months. CentOS Stream has a 5 year lifecycle, and thus HeliumOS will provide a minimum of 5 years of updates.\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n\r\nUsers should be aware of the risks of using a new Linux distribution or Operating System: lack of community, bus factor, etc. bootc is a critical part of HeliumOS, and is currently in a \"Technology Preview\" state. Untill bootc reaches an appropriate level of maturity, HeliumOS will not be considered stable.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nHeliumOS is seeking contributors; Testers, developers and designers are needed. CentOS Stream 10 is expected to be released within the next year, so it is possible for HeliumOS 10 to be the first stable release, ending HeliumOS 9 as a pre-release.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nSee [Pre-Releases](https://www.heliumos.org/releases/pre-release/) to download HeliumOS v9-Alpha",

            "content": "Welcome to the first installment of \"This Month in HeliumOS\", a monthly blog series where we'll be sharing updates and news around HeliumOS! If you're interested in contributing or sharing your own HeliumOS-related news, please join us in our <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#heliumos:matrix.org\" class=\"link\">Matrix space</a>.\r\n\r\n## User Experience\r\n- **GNOME Software update**: GNOME Software has been bumped to the version typically distributed with GNOME 45. This resolves problems caused by using earlier versions of GNOME Software and Flatpak repositories together.\r\n- **GNOME Web replaces Chromium**: Chromium has been replaced by GNOME Web in the system image. This change was made because our users should have a web browser available out of the box and the liberty to use the web browser of their choice. GNOME Web requires less storage space and integrates better with the rest of the GNOME desktop on HeliumOS.\r\n- **Graphical booting with Plymouth**: HeliumOS now uses Plymouth for graphical booting, providing a visually appealing loading screen during boot. If you use disk encryption, you'll be able to type the decryption password into a graphical prompt instead of a text interface.\r\n- **System Images app**: A new System Images app has been added to HeliumOS, allowing you to easily check for updates, perform manual upgrades, and (soon) switch between different operating system variants. System Images is also known as <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/HeliumOS/bootc-gtk\" class=\"link\">bootc-gtk</a>.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n- **Canary release**: HeliumOS now offers a canary release. This variant is suitable for users interested in access to HeliumOS updates sooner and willing to tolerate a slightly higher risk of instability.\r\n- **Official roadmap**: We're now publishing a roadmap on the HeliumOS website. Checkout our <a href=\"https://www.heliumos.org/roadmap/\" class=\"link\">roadmap</a> to learn more about our plans for the future. Currently, we're working on an \"Edge\" edition of HeliumOS. This edition will have better support for newer hardware by using a more recent version of the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n## Fixes & Misc\r\n- **New wallpapers**: We've added new wallpapers to HeliumOS. If you like the GNOME 40 default backgrounds, enjoy!\r\n- **Session exit fix**: We fixed a bug that caused a 25-second delay when logging out or otherwise exiting your session. The confirmation prompt now appears immediately.\r\n- **Updated base images**: HeliumOS has been newly rebased on AlmaLinux 9.4's bootc images.\r\n\r\nThat's all for now, more updates next month!",

            "content": "Welcome again to This Month in HeliumOS! This time we have a few changes with a focus on hardware and infrastructure. If you're interested in contributing or sharing your own HeliumOS-related news, please join us in our <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#heliumos:matrix.org\" class=\"link\">Matrix space</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n- **Edge Edition**: HeliumOS Edge Edition is a new variant that brings HeliumOS to newer devices. The kernel/drivers are derived directly from the leading-edge Fedora distribution. The rest of the software is primarily based on CentOS Stream, which tracks ahead of other Enterprise Linux distributions. If your hardware is too recent for the standard edition of HeliumOS, try HeliumOS Edge instead!\r\n\r\n- **Build Infrastructure**: The bootc images that deliver HeliumOS updates are built using Continuous Integration (CI). We have migrated from quay.io to GitHub Actions for CI for more flexible and efficient builds. Unlike before, build logs are now publicly available.\r\n\r\n- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Additionally, HeliumOS bootc images are available from oci.heliumos.org instead of quay.io. Current installations of HeliumOS will continue to update without breaking. Our server at oci.heliumos.org uses `HTTP 307` redirects to deliver images from quay.io despite the different URI. We are currently developing <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/HeliumOS/oci-registry-router\" class=\"link\">OCI Registry Router</a> to further improve our deployment system.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n- **Hardware Compatibility Information**: One major barrier to adoption for many operating systems is a lack of known compatible hardware. Fortunately, some hardware vendors verify hardware for Enterprise Linux distributions. As an Enterprise Linux derivative, HeliumOS is compatible with these devices. See  the <a href=\"/hardware/\" class=\"link\">Hardware Compatibility List</a>.\r\n\r\nThat's all for now, more updates next month!",

            "content": "Welcome to October 2024's installment of  This Month in HeliumOS! The changes this month were few and may have gone unnoticed.\r\n\r\n## User Experience\r\n\r\n- **Mutable Exceptions**: This change may not affect ordinary users, however it should delight developers and power users. The */opt* and */usr/local* directories are now mutable, allowing system administrators to install software to those locations.\r\n\r\n- **Docker**: Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and the Docker CLI are tools used by many developers for the containerization of software. Although Podman is also installed, the addition of Docker to HeliumOS installations makes some Podman-incompatible use-cases possible. You may wish to follow the Docker <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/\" class=\"link\">post-installation steps</a>.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n- **Edge Edition**: HeliumOS Edge Edition brings HeliumOS to newer hardware. Previously, the Linux kernel distributed with HeliumOS Edge was repurposed from a Fedora package. Due to various concerns, this has been replaced by the mainline kernel provided by the ELRepo Project. As of this month, HeliumOS Edge Edition is now running Linux 6.11 instead of 6.8.
