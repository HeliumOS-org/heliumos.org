However, there are a couple of steps needed to use Docker.\r\n\r\nFor rootful Docker:\r\n\r\nEnable the Docker Daemon using the terminal\r\n<br/>\r\n```shell\r\nsudo systemctl enable --now docker.service\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can use rootful Docker with `sudo docker ps` or similar commands. If you want to use rootful Docker without sudo, see the official [Docker Engine documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) for more details.\r\n\r\nFor rootless Docker:\r\n\r\nRun the rootless Docker helper script\r\n<br/>\r\n```shell\r\ndockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocker containers managed using commands such as `docker ps` will now be rootless.",
