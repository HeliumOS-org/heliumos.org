            "question": "Why is HeliumOS \"Atomic\"?",
            "answer": "The most reliable operating systems use an atomic system for core software distribution. In the case of HeliumOS, new updates are distributed via OCI-Compatible <a href=\"https://containers.github.io/bootc/\" class=\"link\">Bootable Container</a> images. Regardless of power failures or similar interruptions, your system will never be in a broken partially-updated state.",

            "answer": "### Ubuntu\r\n\r\nUbuntu is a commercial Linux distribution based on Debian. Both Ubuntu and HeliumOS focus on providing an easy-to-use desktop experience. Unlike Ubuntu, HeliumOS does not use snap packages and HeliumOS is part of the Red Hat family of Linux distributions.\r\n\r\n### Fedora\r\n\r\nFedora is a community Linux distribution that serves as the upstream for CentOS Stream, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, AlmaLinux, and other distributions. Fedora and the Universal Blue project both offer atomic desktop operating systems based on Fedora. While Fedora has a 13 month lifecycle, HeliumOS has a 10 year lifecycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### AlmaLinux\r\n\r\nAlmaLinux is an enterprise Linux distribution that is a successor to the original CentOS. HeliumOS is directly based on AlmaLinux and derives many components such as the Linux kernel and GNOME desktop from AlmaLinux. Unlike AlmaLinux, HeliumOS focuses on providing an atomic desktop experience suitable for all users.",
